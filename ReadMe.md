A website where every window you open from it has a planet in the centre. Rockets will travel from planet to planet and get accurate paths and timing between the actual distance between planets

Rockets will be randomly generated or can be manually send

Computing and data exchange are preferably done client side in browser, if that is not possible a nodejs server could be setup to handle this

How to run:
1. build typescript with `npm run`
2. open the index.html in a browser (this needs to be better)
